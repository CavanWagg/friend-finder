# Seinfeld and friends match

## Description
*Friend Finder* takes user responses from a short survey and upon submitting, an existing set of survey results that most closely matches the user's is returned. The app uses Express.js as a server framework within node for building out the api. I love the show Seinfeld so I used names and images of the characters from the show within my friendsArray. 

## Demo
